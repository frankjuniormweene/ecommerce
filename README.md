ecommerce was created by NIPA Computer Science Students. This project was an assignment for creating a client-server site to enhance communication.
The site uses php and ajax for the scripting, Mysql for the database, html,bootstrap, and css for the design and finally javascript for the responsiveness and data validation plus verification


Database name = e_commerce

For you to run this site you need a localhost software such as xampp.
